## Introduction to Variables

Variables are placeholders that store and manipulate data during a conversation. They hold information such as:

- **User Inputs**: Data collected from user responses (e.g., names, email addresses).
- **System Data**: Information from external sources like CRM systems.
- **Computed Values**: Results of expressions or calculations within the conversation flow.

**Why Are Variables Important?**

- **Personalize Interactions**: Tailor conversations to individual users.
- **Control Conversation Flow**: Make decisions and branch dialogues based on variable values.
- **Store and Reuse Information**: Keep track of data throughout the conversation.
- **Integrate with External Systems**: Enrich conversations with data from other systems.
- **Include in Actions**: Use variables in actions like sending emails or SMS messages with personalized content.

## Accessing the Variable Management Panel

Variables can be managed in both **Simple Mode** and **Advanced Mode (Tree Editor)**.

### In Simple Mode

- **Variable Icon**: Represented by a **"+"** symbol.
- **Location**: Found in the Flow Configuration page, within scripts or actions where variables can be used.
- **Access**: Click the **"+"** icon to open the Variable Management Panel.

### In Advanced Mode (Tree Editor)

- **Variable Icon**: Represented by a **"+"** symbol inside nodes.
- **Location**: Within the nodes on the Tree Editor page.
- **Access**: Click the **"+"** icon inside a node to open the Variable Management Panel.

## Creating and Managing Variables

### Creating a New Variable

1. **Open the Variable Management Panel** by clicking the **"+"** icon.
2. **Click "Add New"**.
3. **Enter Variable Details**:
   - **Name**: Use clear, descriptive names  (e.g., ``Customer Name`). Avoid spaces and special characters.
   - **Data Type**: Choose from String, Number, Boolean, Date/Time.
   - **Default Value** (Optional): Assign an initial value.
   - **Description** (Optional): Briefly explain the variable's purpose.
4. **Click "Update"** to save.

### Editing and Deleting Variables

- **Edit**: Click the Edit icon next to the variable, make changes, and click "Update".
- **Delete**: Click the Delete icon next to the variable and confirm. Ensure the variable is not in use before deleting.

## Using Variables in Conversations

### Collecting User Input into Variables

   - **In Simple Mode**: Simply add a variable to the question step; this will automatically store the user's response into that variable.
   - **In Simple Mode**: In the node's configuration, locate the **"Store In Variable"** field.

### Inserting Variables into Agent Scripts

1. **Compose the Agent's Script** in any text field.
2. **Insert Variable Placeholder** using the **"+"** icon next to text fields.

**Example**:

- **Script**: "Thank you for calling, `Customer Name`!"

### Using Variables in Actions

1. **Add an Action Node** (e.g., Email Node, SMS Node).
2. **Configure the Action**:
   - **Message Content**: Include variables in the content.
3. **Insert Variables** using the **"+"** icon next to text fields.

**Example in SMS Node**:

- **Message Content**: "Hello `Customer Name`, your appointment on `Appointment Date` is confirmed."

## Implementing Conditional Logic with Variables

### Conditional Branching

1. **Enable Conditional Transitions** in a node's configuration.
2. **Add Conditions** using variables and operators (e.g., `Satisfaction Score>= 4`).
3. **Label Each Condition**.
4. **Connect to Subsequent Nodes**.

**Example**:

- **Variable**: `satisfactionScore`
- **Conditions**:
  - If `Satisfaction Score>= 4`, proceed to positive feedback.
  - If `Satisfaction Score< 4`, proceed to improvement inquiry.

## Setting Up Variable Options

### Creating Multiple-Choice Questions

1. **Create or Edit a Variable**.
2. **Define Options** in the **Options** tab.
3. **Use in a Question Node** to present options to the user.

**Example**:

- **Variable**: `issueType`
- **Options**: "Billing", "Technical Support", "General Inquiry"
- **Question**: "Please select the type of issue you're experiencing:"

### Using Coded Values

1. **Enable Coded Values** in the **Options** tab.
2. **Assign Codes** to each option.

**Example**:

- **Options with Codes**:
  - "Billing" - Code: `1`
  - "Technical Support" - Code: `2`

## Populating Variables from External Data

### Adding Variables via the Platform (Outbound Campaigns)

1. **Access Outbound Campaigns**.
2. **Download the Lead Template**, which includes columns for your variables.
3. **Fill in Lead Data** in the CSV file.
4. **Upload the CSV** back to the platform.

**Example CSV Entry**:

| phoneNumber  | customerName | membershipStatus |
|--------------|--------------|------------------|
| +1234567890  | Jane Smith   | Gold             |

### Adding Variables via API

1. **Use the Add Lead API Endpoint**: `PUT /v1/Outbound/{outboundId}/Lead`.
2. **Include Variables** in the `callData` field.

**Example Request**:

```http
PUT /v1/Outbound/{outboundId}/Lead
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <token>

{
  "phoneNumber": "+1234567890",
  "externalId": "lead123",
  "callData": {
    "customerName": "Jane Smith",
    "membershipStatus": "Gold"
  }
}
```

### Sending Variables in Single On-Demand Calls

1. **Use the Make Call API Endpoint**: `POST /v1/Outbound/{outboundId}/Call`.
2. **Include Variables** in the `callData` field.

**Example Request**:

```http
POST /v1/Outbound/{outboundId}/Call
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <token>

{
  "to": "+1234567890",
  "callData": {
    "firstName": "John",
    "accountBalance": "$100"
  }
}
```

## Best Practices for Using Variables

- **Use Descriptive Names**: Name variables clearly (e.g., `Customer Email`).
- **Define Variables Early**: Plan before building the conversation.
- **Avoid Unnecessary Variables**: Keep the list clean.
- **Test Thoroughly**: Simulate conversations to ensure correctness.
- **Handle Data Securely**: Be cautious with personal information.
- **Document Variables**: Use descriptions for clarity.

## Examples

### Example 1: Personalizing an Outbound Call

**Scenario**: Notifying customers about a service upgrade.

1. **Variables**:
   - `customerName` (String)
   - `currentPlan` (String)
2. **Script**: "Hello {customerName}, we're excited to inform you about an upgrade to your {currentPlan} plan."
3. **Collect Interest**:
   - "Would you like to hear more about this upgrade?"
   - Store response in `interested` (Boolean).
4. **Implement Conditional Logic**:
   - If `interested` is true, proceed with details.
   - If false, thank the customer and end the call.
5. **Adding Leads via CSV**: Use the platform to import leads with variables.

### Example 2: Dynamic Survey with Conditional Logic

**Scenario**: Gathering customer feedback.

1. **Ask Satisfaction Score**:
   - "On a scale of 1 to 5, how satisfied are you with our service?"
   - Store in `satisfactionScore` (Number).
2. **Conditional Paths**:
   - If `Satisfaction Score>= 4`, thank the customer.
   - If `Satisfaction Score< 4`, ask for improvement suggestions.
3. **Follow-Up Actions**: Send a follow-up email using collected data.
